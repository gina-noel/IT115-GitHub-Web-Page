<h1>Web Design Basics</h1>
<h3>Color Theory</h3>
<p>Color psychology is the idea that color can change your perception without you even realizing it. Marketers have been using color theory for years to convey an image before a word is said, and the same is certainly true for web design. 
Whether it is a clean and stark site with black, white and neutral tones, or a loud and bright page with primary colors, you may already have in your mind what this page looks like or sells. 
This speaks to what a substantial influence color is before we have even included other factors like fonts or images, or programming language like CSS or Javascript.
