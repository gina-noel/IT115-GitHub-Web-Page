Fonts or word type also have a substantial impact on the idea a consumer may have about a company or product. There are 4 font types: Serif, sans serif, display and script. 
Serif is the oldest font type which looks like it is sitting on a serif or line. It is considered a more formal font, and more ornamental.
Sans serif literally means without serif. It is a simpler and considered a less formal font. 
Display fonts are characterized as very decorative and may not have much in common with each other like the other font families are. The thing they have in common is that they are all used for titling and never for the body of a document
Script fonts, as the name implies are fonts that mimic handwriting. They are fancy, and may have a tilted angle. They are used for wedding invitations and very formal invitations.
