Fonts: serif, sans serif etc

How visually impaired people view the web(Gina)

(Ted)There is always an object or purpose to any web page. In this article by Alan Smith, the author talks about a CTA, or a “Call to Action.” Whether you want viewers to sign up, make a purchase, or simply find and view the content you are publishing, this CTA must be very clear and apparent from the instant they see the page. He encourages designers to make sure the call to action is the very first element a user sees when they view a page.
(Ted)Here is an article about print/web design, in which the author talks about how a visual grid system for displaying text and documents has its roots in the first century (possibly older)
