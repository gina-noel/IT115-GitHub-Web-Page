      <h3>History of Web Design</h3>
      <p>
        The very first website on the World Wide Web was created by Tim
        Berners-Lee who designed the website at the Swiss research center, CERN
        (European Organization for Nuclear Research). You can still access the
        basic CERN website which was developed for the purpose of distributing
        information to other researchers.

      <h3>What is Web Design?</h3>
      <p>
        Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the
        internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website
        development rather than software development. ... A web designer works
        on the appearance, layout, and, in some cases, content of a website..
