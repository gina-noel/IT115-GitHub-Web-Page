      <h3>Color Theory</h3>
      <p>
        Color psychology is the idea that color can change your perception
        without you even realizing it. Marketers have been using color theory
        for years to convey an image before a word is said, and the same is
        certainly true for web design. Whether it is a clean and stark site with
        black, white and neutral tones, or a loud and bright page with primary
        colors, you may already have in your mind what this page looks like or
        sells. This speaks to what a substantial influence color is before we
        have even included other factors like fonts or images, or programming
        language like CSS or Javascript.

      <h3>Font Types</h3>
      <p>
        Fonts or word type also have a substantial impact on the idea a consumer
        may have about a company or product. There are 4 font types: Serif, sans
        serif, display and script. Serif is the oldest font type which looks
        like it is sitting on a serif or line. It is considered a more formal
        font, and more ornamental. Sans serif literally means without serif. It
        is a simpler and considered a less formal font. Display fonts are
        characterized as very decorative and may not have much in common with
        each other like the other font families are. The thing they have in
        common is that they are all used for titling and never for the body of a
        document Script fonts, as the name implies are fonts that mimic
        handwriting. They are fancy, and may have a tilted angle. They are used
        for wedding invitations and very formal invitations.
